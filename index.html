    <h1>Sai Baba of Shiri</h1>

    <p>
      Sai Baba of Shirdi (died 15 October 1918), also known as Shirdi Sai Baba,
      was an Indian spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees to be a
      manifestation of Sri Dattaguru and identified as a saint and a fakir. He
      was likely born around 1838 and was revered by both his Hindu and Muslim
      devotees during, as well as after, his lifetime.

      According to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of
      "realization of the self" and criticized "love towards perishable things".
      His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping
      others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to the God and
      guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true Satguru, who,
      having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple
      through the jungle of spiritual training.

      Sai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains
      unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no
      consequence to Sai Baba. His teachings combined elements of Hinduism and
      Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived,
      practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures
      that drew from both traditions and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his
      well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek
      (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He
      is also known to have said "Look to me, and I shall look to you" and Allah
      tera bhala karega(translation: god will do you good) . He was said to be
      an incarnation of Dattatreya.
